Notes by Nick Slaney

Reza looked at Yaacov’s specs
Blocktank allows user to request LSP channel with channel specs
- Channel is set up before user makes any payments
Breez works by user telling LSP about a payment they’re looking to receive and LSP opens channel and takes fee in line
- Payee can decide not to accept LSP feerate, and channel is not opened
- LSP decides channel size
- User could request different channel size
Breez shares payment secret with LSP
- Payment secret is not the preimage
- Payment secret = payment address
How does breez choose what size channel to make when requested?
Where is trust in the system?
- Blocktank – user trusts LSP to open channel
-- Might be able to make this trustless
-- Allow user to pay on-chain, LSP opens channel from there
- Breez – user does not have to trust LSP
API should provide fee information etc.
Fees
- Different ways user could want to pay fees
- Upfront
- Only routing fees– likely opened from user
- Combo – tiers, other methods, feerates, lending rates etc.
- Recurring channel maintenance fees
-- Could signal counterparty the need to pay a fee to keep channel open
-- Could raise fees with inactivity
- User can check on channel lease, – or LSP can signal to user
API could use liquidity ads, or communicate out of band (onion messages/bolt12?), potentially offer combination of both
