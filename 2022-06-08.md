**Attendees:** 
Bosch, John Carvalho (Blocktank), Reza Bandegi (Blocktank), Pavel Nikolov, Akiba Slama (Breez), Roy Sheinfeld (Breez), Lucas de C. Ferreira (LL)
Notes by Nick Slaney

Want to make APIs common
Blocktank all open source, comparing to Breez etc.
Roy would like to open Breez to third party LSPs
Wants to keep LSP open source
“Marketplaces”
- How to represent to user that there are LSP options?
- UI to allow choice
- Or maybe wallet chooses LSP automatically in the background
- API to match users with LSPs
- How to choose the right LSP?
- Single or multiple LSPs
- Magma
- Pool
- Liquidity Ads
-- Has mechanism to punish channel openers when they close too early
-- Roy prefers to focus on web interface / HTTP
Simple URL standard- request / responses
Agree on basic API
- Next step is marketplaces– how to find / pick different / new LSPs
- How do we rate LSPs? Reputation? BOS score
- 1. Showing pricing for channels, commitment, selling automating channels
- John - we could expand to a lot of things
- Roy - LSP should be focused on selling channels
- Peerswap, offline payments etc. should be LWS
(Roy wants LSP to be focused on channels only)
- Trampoline payments, onion messages OK, LSP represents closest node
- Fiat conversion– mobile notifications offline
- Synonym’s Hub product feels different from an LSP, so distinction can make sense
Breez + Blocktank (Akiba + Reza) will try to merge an API
- Breez is GRPC
- Blocktank is REST
- GRPC or REST? Both?
- Will work on converging APIs
May need features from the node implementations
Can do things in plugins– but would be better to have nodes code things in – LSP version of a node
Should get more LSPs into the group
